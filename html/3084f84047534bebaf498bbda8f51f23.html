<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">This simulation depicts the set-up of the split riveting process. In this video, we could see that on the left side of the screen, we have the full assembly of the riveting process using split type of rivet consisting of guide, punch, rivet (billet), upper plate, lower plate and lower fixed die; which is meant for joining the two plates shown in green and yellow colour together. The right side of the screen shows the kinematics of the punch, rivet, upper and lower plate in a more simplified manner along with the meshing.&nbsp;</td>
