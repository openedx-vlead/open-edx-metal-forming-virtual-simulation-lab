<p>In this video, one could observe the basic drawing operation taking place on the left hand side. The initial circular plate is taken as cold. It is kept in between the two stationary central dies with movable side dies both on the upper and the lower side. As the movable dies move keeping central part stationary cupping of the plate takes place. On the right hand side, one could observe the equivalent strain generated in the circular plate which can be determined through the scale on left.</p>
