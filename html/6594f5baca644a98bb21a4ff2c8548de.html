<p>This sheet metal bending simulation depicts, a method to reduce Spring back is shown. The punch used here is of v shape &amp; the die of rectangular shape. The bend produced in the sheet is of the same angle as that of the punch. The bottom of the sheet does not touch the lower portion of the bottom die. The sheet taken here is of 1mm in thickness. Punch velocity in downward direction is 3 mm/s. The variation of the punch force required is shown in the graph on the right side. The maximum punch force is 0.08 tonne. The colored strip on the left side shows the different values of equivalent strain produced.&nbsp;</p>
