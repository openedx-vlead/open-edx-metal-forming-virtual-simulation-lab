<p>A hydraulic press is a device in which a large compressive force is exerted on the larger of the two pistons in a pair of hydraulically coupled cylinders by means of the relatively low force been applied to the smaller piston. The working of the machine is based on the Pascalï¿½s law. A hydraulic press consists of frame with two or four columns, pistons, cylinders, rams and hydraulic pumps driven by electric motors . In the given video we see that the two sections, with left one depicting the various components of the hydraulic press whereas the right one depicting the working of the hydraulic press. In the left side we see the hydraulic press consists of parts like the main cylinder with the two pipes at the upper and lower end of it, the piston, shaft and the ram assembly and also the ram guide. The working fluid is the water itself which is kept in cylinders. The right side of the screen shows the working of the hydraulic press, here we can see the piston which is been kept inside the hydraulically filled cylinder is been allowed to move to and fro in the vertical direction by the action of the hydraulic force which is been applied by incoming pressurised water. Initially at the downward stroke of the piston the water is been pressurised through the upper pipe into the cylinder and during this stroke the work-piece is been pressed hydraulically with the constant pressure making it to deform in a continuous material flow manner. Whereas at the upward stroke(i.e. at the retrieval stroke) the water is been pressurised through the lower pipe into the cylinder or is withdrawn through the upper pipe only.&nbsp;</p>
