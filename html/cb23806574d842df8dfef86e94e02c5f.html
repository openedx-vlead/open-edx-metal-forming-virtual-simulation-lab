<p>Mechanical presses are stroke limited ones. They are of either the crank or the eccentric type, with speeds varying from a maximum at the centre of the stroke to zero at the bottom. In the given video we can see that the two sections, with left one depicting the various components of the mechanical press whereas the right one depicting the working of the mechanical press. In the left side of the screen we can see the various components of the mechanical press, the parts include the huge flywheel with the eccentric shaft connected to it, the connecting rod connecting the eccentric shaft with the ram or the slide, the frame mounted on top of the table which contains the ram into it. The right side of the screen shows how the kinematics of such a linkage type looks like. The rotating motion of the big flywheel is been transmitted to the reciprocating motion of the ram/slide by connecting in between them the connecting rod. The ram moves to and fro in the vertical direction inside the boundaries of the frame with the workpiece kept at the bottom of the frame and at the top of the table which is been compressed and deformed with each successive blows of the mechanical press slowly and gradually, up until it takes the required shape and size. Here the work-piece is reduced in its height whereas gets increased in its cross-sectional area. The force available for deforming work-piece depends upon the stroke position and becomes extremely large at the bottom-dead-centre position; thus, proper setup is essential to avoid breaking the dies or other equipment.&nbsp;</p>
