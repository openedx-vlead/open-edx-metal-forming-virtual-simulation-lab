<p>Stretchforming process is a cold working bending process. In this video you can see a sheet is clamped with the help of bolts in clampers. The temperature of billet maintained to 20oC and material of the billet is carbon steel. Hydraulic press is used to deform the billet. The Lower die with hydraulic press compresses the billet with high force in upward direction and stretching take place in the sheet. Due to high deforming force and low temperature, material starts deforming plastically and at final step it has permanent elongation.On the Right side video you can see the system setup arrangement and the initial and final shape of the billet.</p>
