<p>&nbsp;On the left hand side one can see the Step 2 of crankshaft hot forging. One can visualize the changes in microstructure in crankshaft by seeing changes in the mesh. On the right hand side, the picture shows 3 red parts. The 1<sup>st</sup> red part is the initial billet which is used for 1<sup>st</sup> step forging. The 2nd red part shows the forged billet after the 1<sup>st</sup> step. This is the intermediate step. The 3rd red part shows the final forged crankshaft after forging in step-2. The lower two yellow parts shows the upper dies used for step 1 and step 2 processes respectively. The green coloured part shows the lower die which used for both steps.&nbsp;</p>
