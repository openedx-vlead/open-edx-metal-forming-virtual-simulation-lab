<p>This simulation depicts the set-up of the swaging process along-with the initial and the finally formed billet. In this video, we could see that on the left side of the screen, we have the assembly of this swaging process in motion, the four symmetric punches been pressed against the workpiece to and fro in the radial inward and outward directions. The right side of the screen shows the sketch of the initial billet taken and on below of it the finally formed billet after this process.&nbsp;</p>
