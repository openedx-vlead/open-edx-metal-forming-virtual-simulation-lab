<p>In this simulation on the left side of the screen we can see the initial set-up of this forging process consisting of upper die, lower die and a billet. The upper die with the particular profile presses against the billet as it comes down in its downward stroke and imparts a specific shape to the billet, which is backed up by the lower stationary die. Here we can see that as the upper die moves down the sharpened edge protruding from the upper die meets with the sharp edges of the billet which increases friction, and due to inherited die design flaw (that usually occurs when dealing with such shapes) the billet could not be able to completely fill the die cavity at the end of the stroke. The right side of the screen shows the simulation results obtained from the effective strain analysis carried out during this process.</p>
