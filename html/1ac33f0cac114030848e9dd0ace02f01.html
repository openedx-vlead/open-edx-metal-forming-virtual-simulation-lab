<p>The given video depicts the motion and kinematics of the gravity drop forge hammer. Here we can visualise the reciprocating nature of the upper die which itself is connected with links like piston and ram, moving in an upward and downward direction repeatedly at a constant acceleration which is none other than the gravity pull of the earth. The rollers are placed in order to guide the long moving shaft connecting ram to move with the to and fro motion easily without being buckled. The billet is placed in the die cavity of the lower die that remains stationary. Here in this process the energy required for the deformation of the billet i.e. the strain energy is been supplied by the kinetic energy of the moving hammer which itself gets that energy due its potential energy, by making the hammer to fall from the certain height. The effect of such a tremendous force will be that, the billet will tend to deform rapidly with the decrease of its height and subsequent increase in its cross-sectional area at each stroke of the ram. The process is repeated till the desired shape is obtained.&nbsp;</p>
