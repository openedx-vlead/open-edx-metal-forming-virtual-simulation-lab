<p>Bead forming is used to make a round corner of a sheet or a rod. In this video one can see the setup of beading process for forming a bead at the strip end. The upper die moves downward which bends the strip end and forms it to bead shape. On right hand side, forging force required is shown. The maximum force is 0.25 tones. Lower the value of forging force, more easily a metal forming process can be done, and there is a requirement of machinery of lower size.</p>
