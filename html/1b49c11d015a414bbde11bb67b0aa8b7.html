<p>In this simulation video forming of corrugated sheets is shown. The process consists of three parts. The upper die, lower die and the sheet. The thickness of the sheet is 2 mm and material used is c15 steel. The lower die is stationary. Upper die moves in the downward direction to deform the sheet. The angle of teeth of the upper die is 45o.This type of die arrangement is used when the deformation of the sheet is to be controlled from sideways. The upper die moves in the downward direction with a velocity of 5 mm/sec. In the last one can see the final product formed i.e. the corrugated sheet.</p>
