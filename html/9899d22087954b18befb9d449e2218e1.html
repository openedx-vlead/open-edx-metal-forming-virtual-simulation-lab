<p>This simulation depicts the simulation results coming from the split riveting process using the cut plane sectioning technique. In this video, we could see that on the left side of the screen, there is a pattern marked by various colour changes which depicts various zones pertaining to amount of contact between the surfaces. The right side of the screen shows the equilateral strain region pertaining to joining operation of the two plates. Take note of the contour lines near the mating end of the rivet with the two plates, this is more concentrated at the end of the rivet which is immersed in the two plates.&nbsp;</p>
