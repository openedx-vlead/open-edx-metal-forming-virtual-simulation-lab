<p>On the left side, the magnified view of a meshed end of the a rod can be seen. The contours for the equivalent strains generated can be described by comparing it with a scale given on extreme left. On the right side, the red part is the initial rod which has been heated above A C 3 temperature to 900<sup>o</sup> centigrade. In the middle, one could see the quenching water which is at ambient temperature in generalized cases. On the extreme right top side, the rod shown has equivalent strains generated over the surface at the end of the quenching process. The blue circular picture shows the cross section of the rod having no strains initially. The extreme right hand, bottom side, shows the equivalent strains generated at the end of the process in the middle cross section of rod.&nbsp;</p>
