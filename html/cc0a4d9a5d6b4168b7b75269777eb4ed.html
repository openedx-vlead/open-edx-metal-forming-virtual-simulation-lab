<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">In the left hand side we can see the variation of strain in the billet during the operation Initially the strain in the billet is 0.144286 while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation up to 6.57492. Similarly in the right hand top side we can see the variation of the strain with mesh in the billet during the operation. And right hand bottom side we can see the variation in the billet during the operation by the graph.&nbsp;</td>
