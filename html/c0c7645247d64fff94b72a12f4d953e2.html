<p>The video shows the continuous manufacturing of I- Beam using rolling process. The material of the billet is manganese alloy steel. Due to high deforming force and high billet temperature, material starts deforming plastically. Right hand side of video shows variation of equivalent strain on billet. maximum stresses develop at the point of contact of roller and billet. On the top left hand corner a scale is provided for determining the equivalent strain generated during the process.&nbsp;</p>
