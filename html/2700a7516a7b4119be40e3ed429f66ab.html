<p>This sheet metal bending simulation depicts, a common bending operation is shown. Here in this type of bending operation the punch and die both are circular in shape. The sheet here completely touches the lower die when pressed by the punch. The sheet taken here is 1mm in thickness. Punch velocity in downward direction is 3 mm/s. The variation of the punch force required is shown in the graph on the right side. The maximum punch force is 0.38 tonne. The colored strip on the left side shows the different values of equivalent strain generated. The generation of strain can be seen in the bend portion.&nbsp;</p>
