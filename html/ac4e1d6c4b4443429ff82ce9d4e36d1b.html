<p>In this video, one could observe the initial billet being deformed by hammer press. The process of upsetting is not done in a single step but in multiple steps using the same hammer press. On the right side, one could view the billet being deformed in several steps with equivalent strain generated in each step described by the coloured scale. On the left side, the process of deformation can be seen with a scale describing about the equivalent strains being generated in the billet during hammer forging process. In the final step the billet takes up the shape of the dies.</p>
