<h2>Bar Shearing</h2>
<br /> Shearing process is used to cut off material by using punch, die and blank holder. This process is widely applied to make the billet in forging. Sheared surface has smooth area (sheared surface) which is made by metal flow in punch-die clearance, rough area (fracture surface) which is appeared by crack initiation and propagation at the tip of punch and die, burr and shear drop. <br /><br /><span class="blue">Bar Shearing Setup</span>: Bar shearing Process uses four dies, two are stationary and two are moving. The purple and the pink dies shown below are stationary ones, whereas the green and yellow are moving. <br /><br /><center><img src="http://msvs-dei.vlabs.ac.in/images/Barshear/Barshear.png" alt="Bar Shearing Setup" /><br />Figure 1: Bar Shearing</center><br /><span class="blue">Press Used</span>: Hydraulic press is used for the process. The plunger of the press is placed over the green die. The Yellow shear die rests on a hydraulic cushion and moves when force on it reaches 5 tonns or more. <br /><br /><center><img src="http://msvs-dei.vlabs.ac.in/images/Barshear/Press.png" alt="Bar Shearing Press" /><br />Figure 2: Bottom shear die rests on a hydraulic cushion and moves<br />when force on it reaches 5 tonnes or more</center><br /><span class="blue">Sheared Billet</span>: The figure below shows the sheared billet. The right portion of bar is the sheared one whereas the bar on the other side is the left over bar for further shearing. <br /><br /><center><img src="http://msvs-dei.vlabs.ac.in/images/Barshear/Billet.png" alt="Bar Sheared Billet" /><br />Figure 3: Sheared Billet</center></div>
