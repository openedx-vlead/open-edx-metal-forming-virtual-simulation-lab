<p>&nbsp;The video shows the process of manufacturing of angle iron by iron by rolling procedure. Angle iron is generally used in frames and structures. In the video, one could observe the roller deforming the plate. The shape of the roller is such that as the plate progresses forward it takes up the shape in between the rollers. The equivalent strain generated during manufacturing angle iron can be determined using scale on the left. The final deformed plate is later cut using metal cutter in the final step of manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>
