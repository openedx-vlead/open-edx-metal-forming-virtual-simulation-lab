<p>The given simulation describes the various kinds of defects that are arising during a general forging process. Here on the left section of the screen we can see the initial die set-up with the billet in between. The profile of the upper and the lower die is a bit complicated and due to such intricate profile, the formed billet carries multiple types of defects. These defects are shown in detailed view on top right side of the screen with their respective arrows, like the undulated surface cracks in the middle portion, the sheared zone, and finally the flashed part that is emerging out of the billet. The graph on the lower right corner shows the variation of force on die versus time, that depicts the contact forces arising due to impact on the billet at various point in time.&nbsp;</p>
