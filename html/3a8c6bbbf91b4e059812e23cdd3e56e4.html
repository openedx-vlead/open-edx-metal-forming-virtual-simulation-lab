<p>Hexagonal bolt is formed by heading operation. Heading process may be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod or wire or blank. Heading processes can be carried out cold, warm or hot. In the given simulation of hexagonal bolt forming, cold heading process is used. Consider the various parameters of heading simulation. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. The temperature of the billet is 20<sup>o</sup>C. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The mechanical press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the simulation video one can see the processing of hexagonal bolt. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video we can see the upper die or punch and lower die and initial billet and final billet. In the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation in the billet during the heading operation.&nbsp;</p>
