<p>In this simulation we can see that on the left side of the screen we have the full set up of the Transverse Wedge Rolling process using planetary rolls is taking place. This includes components like- the outer roll, the inner roll and the billet in between. Here we can see that the wedge shaped profile included in both the outer and inner rolls, drives against the surface of the billet in an opposite sense of rotation, making the grooved surface on the billet. The right hand top corner shows the result of effective strain generated during this process, the concentration of strain in the contact zone increases as the gap between two concentric wedge shaped rolls decreases. The right hand bottom corner shows the graph between torque applied by rolls versus time taken.&nbsp;</p>
