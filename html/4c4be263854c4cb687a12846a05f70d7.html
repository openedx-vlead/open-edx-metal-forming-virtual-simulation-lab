These may be symptomatic of the use of undersized equipment on jobs that are too big for it. Also, the improper control of lubricant vapours can cause this type of defect.<br /> In this simulation we could see the flash appearing as the die closes to its final position such that at the end of the stroke there is tremendous amount of increase in the die pressure which we could visualise through the peak rise in the shown graph (that is maximum at the moment of the maximum flash appearance in the end).&nbsp;</td>
