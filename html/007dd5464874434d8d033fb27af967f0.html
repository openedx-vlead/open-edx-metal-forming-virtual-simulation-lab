<p>Riveting is type of the forming operation. In a given simulation of cold forming process is used. The riveting operation is normally done in the two step but for ease of the riveting operation done in a single step. Consider the various perimeter of the simulation. The material of the billet is plane carbon steel and the temperature of the billet is 20oC. In the simulation video the billet is in finite element to have better analysis of the force. In this simulation the hydraulic press is used for riveting operation. In the right hand top side of the simulation video we can see the image of punch and the billet and lower die. Similarly in the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation in the billet during the riveting operation. In the right hand side of the video we can see the processing of the riveting operation.</p>
