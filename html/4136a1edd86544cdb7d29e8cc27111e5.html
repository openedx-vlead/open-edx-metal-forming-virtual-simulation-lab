<p>Ring rolling process is used to roll a ring. It is rolled by the help of king roll and the mandrel. The width is maintained by the help of conical rolls. This video shows the equivalent strain generated and the plot of force applied by the mandrel in rolling the ring to its desired curved shape during hot ring rolling process. The value of equivalent strain increases from 0 to 13.9083 as the mandrel rolls the ring. Change in the value of equivalent strain refers to the refinement of the microstructure of the material. Higher the equivalent strain more finer is the microstructure. As the process initiates the force applied increases very steeply then remains approximately constant. The maximum value of the force applied is 78 tones. Lower the value of forging force, more easily a metal forming process can be done, and there is a requirement of machinery of lower size.&nbsp;</p>
