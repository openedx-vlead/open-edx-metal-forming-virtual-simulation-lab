<p>Bushing is formed by FORMING process. Which may be defined as an upsetting process, which is normally performed at the end of the cylindrical round rod. Forming processing can be carried out cold or hot. In the given simulation of bush forming is cold processing is used. The bush forming is normally done in the three steps.</p>
<p>In the first step&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Left hand side of the video we can see the processing of step-1. And right hand top side we can see the initial billet and final billet. Similarly in the right hand bottom side the variation in the billet during the operation.</p>
<p>Now in the second step&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the left hand side of the video we can see the processing of step-2. In the Right hand top side we can see the initial billet and final billet. In the right hand bottom side we can see the variation in the billet during the operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in the third step&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the left hand side of the video we can see the processing of step-3. Similarly in the right hand top side we can see the initial billet and final billet. On the Right hand bottom side we can see the variation in the billet during the operation.</p>
