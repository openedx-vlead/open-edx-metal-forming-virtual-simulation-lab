<p>The video shows the Upset Stage in step 1 followed by Blocker Stage in Step 2 in the multi-step forging. The setup on the left hand side shows the work piece placed between two dies with Upsetting Die in Step 1 followed by Blocker die in Step2 and respective operations taking place in 2 steps. On the top right hand side, the picture describes the intermediate steps in which the multi-step forging is done. The dies are shown with yellow and the initial billet, intermediate stage and product are shown with red in the picture. On the bottom right side the initial billet can be observed being deformed into the final product in two steps and the scale on extreme left side describing equivalent strain being generated in the billet.</p>
