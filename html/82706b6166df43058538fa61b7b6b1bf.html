<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">This sheet metal bending simulation depicts, a simple v bending operation is shown. Here in this type of bending operation the punch does not force the sheet to the bottom of the die cavity, leaving some space underneath, it is called "air bending". The die used here is of rectangular type. A V- groove die can also be used where it must have a sharper angle than the angle being formed in the sheet. The sheet taken here is of 1mm in diameter. Punch velocity in downward direction is 3 mm/s. The variation of the punch force required is shown in the graph on the right side. The maximum punch force is 0.12 tonne. The coloured strip on the left side shows the different values of equivalent strain. The generation of strain can be seen at the bending portion.&nbsp;</td>
