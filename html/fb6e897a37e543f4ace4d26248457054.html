<p>The screw presses derive their energy from a flywheel. The forging load is transmitted through a vertical screw. These presses are energy limited and can be used for many forging operations. They are particularly suitable for producing small quantities, for parts requiring precision (such as turbine blades), and for control of ram speed. In the given video we can see that the two sections of the screen, with left one section depicting the various components of the screw press whereas the right one depicting the working of the screw press. In the left side of the screen we can see the components like the driving wheel, the driven flywheel, the screwed shaft connected to the flywheel, the screwed stationary housing connected with the main cylinder and finally the ram connected with the screwed shaft in the centre of the screen. The right side of the screen shows the kinematics of this process in action i.e. the downward stroke of the ram taking place. As the driving wheel is rotated by the subsequent power drive, the flywheel too gets rotated with its axis perpendicular to the axis of the driving wheel through the action of the frictional force acting in between the wheels in contact. The flywheel not only rotates about its axis but also translates up and down within the driving wheel limits. This action is possible due to the screw type of linkage between the externally threaded shaft connected to the flywheel and the internally threaded stationary housing mounted within cylinder grooves. This motion is been transmitted to the ram which is responsible for deforming the kept work-piece over the table by compressing it till it attains the required shape and size.</p>
