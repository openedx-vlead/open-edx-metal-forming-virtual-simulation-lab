<p>The setup for turbine blade forging is as shown in the video. The yellow part is the plunger, the red part is the billet and the green part holds the blade cavity. During the process, the plunger pushes the billet from left hand side. The billet while moving inside the cavity deforms and takes the shape of the blade cavity inside the green die. In the video, one could see the blue mesh of the blade being formed during the process of forging. One could visualize the mesh size changing which gives an idea about the forces acting on the billet.The finished blade is shown at the end of the video.</p>
