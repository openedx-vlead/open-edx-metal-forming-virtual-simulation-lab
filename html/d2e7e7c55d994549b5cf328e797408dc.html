<p>Valve is formed by post processing. Which may be defined as an upsetting process, which is normally performed at the end of the cylindrical round rod in order to produce larger crossï¿½section. Post processing can be carried out cold or hot. In the given simulation of valve forming cold forming is used. The valve forming is normally done in the three step.</p>
<p>In the case first&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the left hand top &nbsp;side of the video &nbsp;we can see the case of the billet in different stages. In the left hand side of the video we can see the processing of the billet during in the case first. Similarly in the right hand side &nbsp;the punch moving along the upward direction then after billet is converted &nbsp;in the punch shape.</p>
<p>Now in the second step&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the right hand side we can see the punch moving in the upward direction. When the punch moves then the billet also changes and after it comes in the punch shape. In the left hand top &nbsp;side of the video, &nbsp;we can see the case of the billet in different stages. In the left hand side of the video, we can see the processing of the billet during in the case first.</p>
<p>Now in the third step&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the right hand side we can see the punch moving in the upward direction. When the punch moves then the billet also changes and after it comes in the punch shape. In the left hand top &nbsp;side of the video &nbsp;we can see the case of the billet in different stages. In the left hand side of the video, we can see the processing of the billet during in the case first.</p>
<p>Now in &nbsp;the forth step</p>
<p>In the Right hand side we can see the punch moving in the upward direction .when the punch moves then the billet also changes and after it comes in the punch shape. In the left hand top &nbsp;side of the video &nbsp;we can see the case of the billet in different stages. In the left hand side of the video, we can see the processing of the billet during in the case first.</p>
