<p>In this simulation on the left side of the screen we can see the initial set-up of this forging process consisting of upper die, lower die and a billet. The upper die with the particular profile presses against the billet as it comes down in its downward stroke and imparts a specific shape to the billet, which is backed up by the lower stationary die. As the upper die comes in contact with the billet surface, we can see that the material on contact zone instead of flowing inside the cavity gets sheared away from the confined path. The right side of the screen shows the simulation results obtained from the effective strain analysis carried out during this process.&nbsp;</p>
