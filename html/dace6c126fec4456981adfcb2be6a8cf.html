<p>In a given simulation of punching operation, cold forming process is used. In this simulation videothe billet is shown as the rectangular shape. Consider the various perimeters of forming simulation. The material of the billet is plane carbon steel and the temperature of the billet is 20<sup>o</sup>C. In the simulation video the billet is in finite elements to have better analysis of the force. Themechanical press is used forpunching. In the left handside of the simulation video we can see the processing of punching operation. Similarly In the right hand top side of the video we can see the upper die, lower die and final billet after punching operation. The right hand bottom side of the videowe can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the punching operation.&nbsp;</p>
