<p>In the left hand side of the video we can see the variation of the strain in the billet during the operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformationup to 1.0. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video we can see the variation of the strain with mesh in the billet during the operation. In right hand bottom side we can see the variation in the billet during the operation by the graph.&nbsp;</p>
