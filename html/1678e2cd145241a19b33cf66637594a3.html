The various parts of the process are punch, lower, two sheets one over other and the rivet. The process is hot forming in nature. The left hand side of the video shows the positions of various components of the process. Initially the rivet is placed in its position and the punch is moved downward to press the rivet from the top. The right hand top side of the simulation video shows the initial billet and final billet. The right hand bottom side of the video shows the variation in the billet during the deformation.&nbsp;</td>
