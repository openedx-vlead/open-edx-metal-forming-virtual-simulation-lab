<p>The above video shows the forming for a bush. This type of bush is formed in 3 steps. The thickness of the sheet strip used here is 2mm. The material of the sheet used is a copper alloy. In the first step it shows three parts viz a punch, sheet strip and lower die. The upper punch moves in the downward direction to deform the sheet. The sheet is deformed as according to the lower die which is stationary. In the second step the punch of the first step remains stationary at the end position. The two side punches move in towards the centre with equal speed. These two side punches deform the sheet according to the shape of the main punch. In the third step the side punches also remains stationary in there last position and a new upper punch moves in the downward direction. This punch finally shapes the bush in a complete round shape and the process is completed.&nbsp;</p>
