The upper die with the particular profile presses against the billet as it comes down in its downward stroke and imparts a specific shape to the billet, which is backed up by the lower stationary die. Here we can see that as the upper die moves down to its final stroke length, the billet material flows towards the closed die cavity to cover up the space available there, but due to the small web thickness present in the billet the cavity is seen in the magnified view between billet and the die. The right side of the screen shows the simulation results obtained from the effective strain analysis carried out during this process.</p>
