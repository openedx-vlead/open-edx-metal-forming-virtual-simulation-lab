<p>Seamless pipe is formed by forming process. Forming process may be defined as an extrusion process, normally performed at the end of semi-solid round to produces a larger cross-section. Extrusion process can be carried out cold or hot. In a given simulation of seamless pipe forming, cold extrusion process is used. The seamless pipe is normally done in the three steps but for ease of the simulation, seamless pipe is made in a single step. Consider the various parameters of this simulation. The material of the billet is aluminium. The temperature of the billet is 20oC. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite element to have better analysis of the force. The hydraulic press is used for deformation. In the right hand top side of the simulation video one can see the upper die or punch, the billet and lower die and seamless pipe. In the left hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the extrusion operation. Similarly in the right hand side we can see the extrusion process and arrangement of the die and billet.</p>
