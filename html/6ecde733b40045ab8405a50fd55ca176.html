<p>In this video you can see the extrusion process of Aluminium material billet which comprises of a mandrel of different shape in the extrusion die. This process is cold extrusion process where different parameters are controlled on the basis of given specifications. Extrusion forces with respect to pilot height are shown over the graph these Forces are maximum when there is sudden change in area of cross section of the billet. As the pilot height reduces the force required to extrusion of pipe is increases. Right hand side picture showing different parts include in the process. You can easily see the different section of mandrel. Left side coloured strip shows equivalent strain variation in the billet. The upper die is moving and lower die is stationary in extrusion process.</p>
