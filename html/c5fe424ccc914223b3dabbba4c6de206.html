<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">This sheet metal bending simulation depicts, a common method of bending is shown. This method of bending is called Wipe die bending or also called edge bending. Wipe bending requires the sheet to be held by a pressure pad upon the wipe die. The punch then presses against the edge of the sheet that extends beyond the die and pad. The sheet will bend according to the radius of the edge of the wipe die. The sheet taken here is of 1mm in thickness. Punch velocity in downward direction is 3 mm/s. The variation of the punch force required is shown in the graph on the right side. The maximum punch force is 0.10 tonne. The colored strip on the left side shows the different values of equivalent strain. The generation of strain can be seen at the bending portion.&nbsp;</td>
