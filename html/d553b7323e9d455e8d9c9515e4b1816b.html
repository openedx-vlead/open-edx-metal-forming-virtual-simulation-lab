<p>Cold extrusion is the general term often used to denote a combination of processes, such as direct and indirect extrusion and forging. Many materials can be extruded into various configurations, with the billet either at the room temperature or at the temperature of a few hundred degrees. Extrusion process can be defined as the metal forming process which is used to form the product with the fix cross sectional profile. A material is punched onto the die of the desired cross section. In the given video we can see the two sections of the screen, in the left side we can see the various components involved in extrusion process which includes the moving punch, work-piece and the lower fixed die and in the right side we can see the movement of the punch within the lower die cavity. Through this process we will attain the work-piece with increase in the length and with decreased cross-sectional area.&nbsp;</p>
