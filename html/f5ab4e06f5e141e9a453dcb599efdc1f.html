<p><video width="100%" height="600px" controls="controls" src="http://msvs-dei.vlabs.ac.in/Forming/Stretchforming/FormingStrain.mp4"></video> In a given simulation of stretch forming, cold process is used. The seamless pipe is normally done in the single steps. Consider the various parameters of this simulation. The material of the billet is aluminium.The temperature of the billet is 20oC. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite element to have better analysis of the force. The hydraulic press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the video we can see the processing of the stretch forming. In the right hand top side of the simulation video we can see the billet during the operation and final shape. In the right hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation in the billet during the forming operation.</p>
