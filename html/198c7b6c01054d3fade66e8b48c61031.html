The punch used here is not a simple v punch, but at the tip of the punch one can see a bigger end. This type of punch is used to put extra pressure on the sheet to reduce spring back . The sheet taken here is of 1mm in diameter. Punch velocity in downward direction is 3 mm/s. Evolution Of Bending Force With Punch Height is shown in the graph on the right side. The maximum punch force is 1.5 tonne. The colored strip on the left side shows the different values of equivalent strain. The generation of strain can be seen at the bending portion.</p>
