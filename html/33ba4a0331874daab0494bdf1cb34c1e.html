<p>In the left hand side of the video we can see the variation of strain in the billet during the heading operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises upto 3.21625. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video we can see the variation of strain with mesh in the billet during the operation. Similarly in the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the graph. Graph plot between punch and pilot height.&nbsp;</p>
