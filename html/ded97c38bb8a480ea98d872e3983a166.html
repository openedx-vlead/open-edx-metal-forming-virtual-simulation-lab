<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">Piercing is formed by blanking operation. Piercing operation may be defined as an shearing process. In a given simulation ofpiercing, cold process is used. The piercing process is normally done in the two steps but for ease of the simulation, piercing process is made in a single step. Consider the various parameters of this simulation. The material of the billet is aluminium. The temperature of the billet is 20<sup>o</sup>C. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite element to have better analysis of the force. The hydraulic press is used for deformation. In the left hand side we can see the processing of the piercing operation. Similarly In the right hand top side of the simulation video we can see the image of punch, billet and lower die. In the right hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation in the billet during the piercing operation.&nbsp;</td>
