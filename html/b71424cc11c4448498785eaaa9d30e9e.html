In this step, one could observe the circular profile and holes are being formed by the cold forming process. The upper die is moving downwards and one can see the changes in the meshed red sheet. On the right hand, top end, one can observe the equivalent strains generated on the sheet in isometric view, whereas on the right hand, bottom end, one can observe the equivalent strains generated on sheet when a cut plane cuts the sheet. The different colored contours of equivalent strains generated can be described by the scale on the left.</p>
