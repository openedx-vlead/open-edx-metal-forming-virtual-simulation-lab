<p>The left hand side of the video shows the position and the motion of upper die, lower die and the sheet. The sheet is placed on lower die and the upper die presses the sheet. On the right hand top side of the video one can see the variation of strainin the sheet during the bending. While on the right hand bottom side of the video the variation of strain with mesh generated during deformation. Initially the equivalent strain in the sheet was 0 and at the end of the deformation average equivalent strain reaches up to 0.13.</p>
