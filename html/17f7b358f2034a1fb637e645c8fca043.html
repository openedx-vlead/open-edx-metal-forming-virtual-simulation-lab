<p>On left hand side, the full in section of hydroforming setup is shown. The tube is shown in red, the die in green and pistons in yellow. As the piston pushes the tube, the tube occupies the cavity under fluid pressure. On the right hand side, a picture is shown. The top end of the picture shows the full in section of setup of a basic Hydroforming process. The die is a tube shown in green. The tube is shown in red and is placed in the die having a cavity. The piston is shown in yellow and it moves in the green die which consists of fluid. On the bottom end of the picture, transformation from initial shape of tube to final shape of tube is shown.&nbsp;</p>
