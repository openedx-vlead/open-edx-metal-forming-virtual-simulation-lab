<p>In the left hand side of the video one can see the variation of strain with mesh in the billet during the rolling operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises upto 6.8406.Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. In the right hand top side we can see the upper roller and lower roller. Similarly in the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation in the billet during the operation by the graph. &nbsp;</p>
