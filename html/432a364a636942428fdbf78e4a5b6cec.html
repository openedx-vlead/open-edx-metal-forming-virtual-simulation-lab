<p>&nbsp;The left hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the forming operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises up to 1.806 greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly In the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation of strain with mesh during the operation. And in the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation by the graph . graph plot between the upper dei and pilot height.&nbsp;</p>
