<p>&nbsp;In the present simulation we try to demonstrate the applicability of top down grain refinement approach (severe plastic deformation process) in manufacturing these high strength artificial body implants. SPD has many techniques, among these techniques Equal Channel Angular pressing (ECAP) is one of the most successful technique because it is only known process which can be implemented at commercial level. Here in the present work we try to make an artificial Hip joint by using ECAP processed specimen. First a titanium alloy billet (25 mm diameter and 200 mm length) is processed through a ECAP die having intersection angle 1200 and outer arc angle 200 at room temperature. Now after that processed specimen is placed in between the specially built hip bone shaped dies These dies are hydraulic power operated and transformed the ECAPed specimen into desirable artificial hip bone shape. Now here we can see the artificial hip joint with flash. All process steps involved in artificial hip joint manufacturing is shown here.&nbsp;</p>
