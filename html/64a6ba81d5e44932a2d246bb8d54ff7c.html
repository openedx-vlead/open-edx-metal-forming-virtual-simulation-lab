<p>Roll bending is the process in which the metallic bar of any cross-section area undergoes both plastic and elastic deformation. In the process shown above, we have three rollers namely upper, middle and lower. The process starts by inserting the bar initially between the upper and lower rollers. The rollers are then rotated moving the bar along with them such that the middle roller is forced against the bar. When either end of the bar is reached, the force applied to the middle roller is incrementally increased. For better approximation of desired radius of a circular arc, a number of passes are required. This could be done by reversing the rotation of the rollers. This simulation uses a T-shaped rod of aluminium alloy involving ï¿½ = 0.2 friction.&nbsp;</p>
