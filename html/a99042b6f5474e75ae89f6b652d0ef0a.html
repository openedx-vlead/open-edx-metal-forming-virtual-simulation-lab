Considering the various perimeters of rolling simulation. The material of the billet (sheet) is plane carbon steel and the temperature of the billet is high. In the simulation video the billet is infinite elements to have better analysis of the force. The rolling press is used. In the left handside of the simulation video we can see the manufacturing of angle rolling. And in the right hand top side of the video we can see the plain sheet and final final sheet. The right hand bottom side of the videowe can see the variation of strain in the billet during the rolling operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises up to 6.4806 greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties.&nbsp;</td>
