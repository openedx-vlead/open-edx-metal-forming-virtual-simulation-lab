<p>The video shows the process of gear formation using extrusion process. On the left side, one can observe the setup for gear extrusion. The extrusion die is shown with green and the punch is shown with yellow. The billet with mesh is shown in red. As the punch pushes the billet in the extrusion die, teeth of gear embossed in the die are engraved in the billet. On the right hand side, one can see the different strain contours, which can be determined by comparison with scale on the left of screen.&nbsp;</p>
