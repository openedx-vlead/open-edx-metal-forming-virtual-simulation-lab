<p>In this simulation on the top side of the screen we can see the initial set-up of this forging process consisting of upper die, lower die and a billet. The upper die with the particular profile presses against the billet as it comes down in its downward stroke and imparts a specific shape to the billet, which is backed up by the lower stationary die. The final formed billet consists of defects like the under-filled portions, cracks, sheared zones, buckled areas etc. The bottom side of the screen shows the simulation results obtained from the effective strain analysis carried out during this process. One can see the strain concentrated zones in the billet which depicts the formation of cracks and other kind of surface irregularities.&nbsp;</p>
