Consider the various perimeters of forming simulation. The material(sheet) of the billet is plane carbon steel and the temperature of the billet is 20<sup>o</sup>C. In the simulation video the billet is in finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The hydraulic press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the processing of corrugated sheet. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video one can see the upper die, billet (plain sheet), lower die and final corrugated sheet. The left hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the forming operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises up to 1.806 greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties.&nbsp;</td>
