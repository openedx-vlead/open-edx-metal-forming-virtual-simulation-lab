<p>This is a simulation for step 2 of bevel gear formation. The resultant billet from step 1 is used for the final gear for formation in the second step. The image on the top right corner shows the dies used for step-2. The yellow is the upper die which forces down the billet to the required shape. The yellow die is moving in downward direction whereas green die is stationary. The image of billet on the right shows the deformation produced in the billet from step-1 to the desired shape.&nbsp;</p>
