<h2>Transverse Wedge Rolling</h2>
<br /> Transverse Wedge Rolling is a process in which a round billet is inserted between appropriately shaped rolls or flat plates that deform the workpiece as it rotates. These tools incorporate a wedge shaped profile, from which the process takes its name.<br /><br /> <span class="blue">There are several versions of Transverse Wedge Rolling:</span><br /><br /> � If rolls are used, they rotate in the same direction and drive the workpiece. Here either two or three rolls (figure1) can be used.<br /> � If flat tools are used, they move in opposite directions while rotating the workpiece between them.<br /> � A planetary system with a single large work roll and a fixed work segment is possible(figure2), or a concave-tooling segments can also be used.<br /><center><img src="http://msvs-dei.vlabs.ac.in/images/Rolling/WedgeRolling/PlanetaryRolls.jpg" alt="Transverse Wedge Rolling using planetary rolls" height="380" width="350" /><br />Figure 1: Transverse Wedge Rolling using planetary rolls<br /><br /> <img src="http://msvs-dei.vlabs.ac.in/images/Rolling/WedgeRolling/ThreeRolls.jpg" alt="Transverse Wedge Rolling using three rolls" height="380" width="370" /><br />Figure 2: Transverse Wedge Rolling using three rolls&nbsp;</center></div>
