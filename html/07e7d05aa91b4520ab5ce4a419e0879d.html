<p>&nbsp;In the given simulation video of hot orbital forming process, one can see the variation of strain generated in the tube. Initially the strain in the tube is zero. The left hand side of the video shows the strain generated in tube side walls. While right hand side of the video shows the inclined view of the tube. Initial the strain in the tube is zero. As the process starts the deformation on the top circumference and the side walls start. With time the deformation increases and hence the strain also increases. Till the end of the process the strain on the top of the tube reaches up to 2.45 while on the side walls it reaches upto 1.75.&nbsp;</p>
