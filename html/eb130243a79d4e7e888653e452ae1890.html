<p>Because the hydrostatic pressure increases the ductility of the material, brittle materials can be extruded successfully through this method. Hydrostatic extrusion is generally carried out at the room temperature, typically using vegetable oils as the fluid, particularly castor oil because it is a good lubricant and its viscosity is not influenced significantly by the pressure. The process must be carried out in a sealed cylinder to contain the hydrostatic medium. In the following video we can see that in the left side of the screen there are various components involved in the hydrostatic extrusion process which includes the working fluid which is been pressed by some piston of the press, this fluid pressurises the pressing stem meant for forcing the punch against the work-piece in the cylinder of smaller cross sectional area where the initial work-piece (i.e. the aluminium bar) is kept with the outer diameter equal to the internal diameter of the cylinder bore in that section, the pressing tool to shape up the cross section of the final extruded component. The right side of the screen shows the working of this technique. As the pressing stem is been moved by the hydraulic pressure action which is been applied by the pressurized fluid, it moves in the downward direction as shown here in the video, the pressing stem with the punch forces the work-piece all along the set bore diameter of the pressing tool, thus decreasing its cross-sectional area to good extent with application of the uniform force all along the punch travel throughout its length of the stroke.&nbsp;</p>
