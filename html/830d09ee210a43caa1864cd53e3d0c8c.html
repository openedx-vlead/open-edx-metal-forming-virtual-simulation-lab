<p>On the left side, one can observe the setup of hot forging of piston. The meshed cylindrical billet is placed in the green die and the yellow upper die is moving downwards. The change in microstructure can be seen with change in mesh size. On the right hand side, the first red part shows the initial billet, the red part in the middle shows the forged piston after forging process and the grey part shows the final piston after machining process. The green picture at bottom shows the lower die and the yellow picture shows the upper die. &copy; Metal Forming Virtual Simulation Lab - Dayalbagh Educational Institute (www.dei.ac.in)</p>
