<p>Patterns used in sand casting may be made of wood, metal, plastics or other materials. Patterns are made to exacting standards of construction, so that they can last for a reasonable length of time, and so that they will repeatably provide a dimensionally acceptable casting. In the video, one could see a picture which has sectioned view explaining about the arrangement to create hollow cavity for casting. The pattern is shown in brown which is placed in the cope and drag. The video shows the method of making the pattern of 3 way valve. The die having a hollow cavity of the shape of 3 way valve is shown in green. The billet is shown in red and plunger is shown in yellow. As the plunger proceeds it deforms the billet and fills the cavity inside the hollow die taking the shape of the pattern which is shown at the end of video.</p>
