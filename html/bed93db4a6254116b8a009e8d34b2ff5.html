<p>&nbsp;In the left hand side of the video we can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the heading operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises upto 3.36107. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly in the right hand top side if he video we can see the variation of strain with mesh in the billet during the operation. Similarly in the left hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation in the billet during the operation by the graph. Graph plot between the pilot height and upper die.&nbsp;</p>
