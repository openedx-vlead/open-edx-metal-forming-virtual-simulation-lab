<p>The video shows Upset Stage in step 1 followed by Blocker Stage in Step 2 in the multi-step forging. The setup on the left hand side shows the work piece placed between two dies with Upsetting Die in Step 1 followed by Blocker die in Step2 and respective operations taking place in 2 steps. A quarter section of dies in operation is shown from all angles for better understanding. On the right side, the graph between force on upper die vs. pilot height in 2 successive stages is shown describing force variations with change in pilot height and the scale on extreme left side describing equivalent strain being generated in the billet.</p>
