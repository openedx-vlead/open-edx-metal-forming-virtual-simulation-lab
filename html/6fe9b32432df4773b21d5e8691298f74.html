<p>This simulation shows the generation of equivalent strain during the step -1 of bevel gear formation. The top right simulation shows the formation of equivalent strain as the upper die moves down. The average equivalent strain generated is 0.61 . The graph for the forging force is shown in the bottom right corner. The maximum force is 10.2 Tones. The simulation at left shows the simulation for bevel gear forging for step -1.&nbsp;</p>
