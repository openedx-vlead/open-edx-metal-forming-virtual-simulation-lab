<p>The above video shows the forming of a door handle. The thickness of the sheet used here is 4 mm. The material of the sheet is Al 2014. In the forming of door handle we require 5 different parts viz punch, sheet, lower die and two pressure pads. The lower die is stationary. Punch moves in the downward direction to press the sheet in the desired form which is kept over the lower die. Two pressure pads are used apply an appropriate pressure on the sheet on the both ends. The maximum force required to deform the sheet is 2.13 tonnes. The maximum stress induced in the sheet is 54.63 Mega Pascal (MPa).&nbsp;</p>
