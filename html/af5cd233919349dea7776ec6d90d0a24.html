<p>Hexagonal bolt is formed by heading operation. Heading process may be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod or wire or blank in order to produce a larger cross-section. Heading processes can be carried out cold, warm or hot. In the given simulation of hexagonal bolt forming, cold heading process is used. In this simulation video only half section of the billet is shown as the billet is symmetric in shape. The hexagonal bolt forming is normally done in three steps but for ease of the simulation ,bolt is made in a single step. Consider the various parameters of heading simulation. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. the temperature of the billet is 65<sup>o</sup>C. In the given simulation the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The mechanical press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the simulation one can see the arrangement of the upper die or punch, the billet and lower die. In the right hand top side of the video one can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the heading operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises up to 1.806. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly in the right hand bottom side of the video one can depicts the variation of temperature in the billet during the operation. At the end of the operation the temperature rises up to 335<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;</p>
