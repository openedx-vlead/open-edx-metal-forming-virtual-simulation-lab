<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">In the left hand side of the video we can see the variation of the strain in the billet during the operation Initially the strain in the billet is 0.218833 while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation up to 2.18833. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly And the right hand bottom side we can see the variation of the strain with mesh in the billet. In the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation in the billet by the graph and graph plot between the pilot height and punch.</td>
