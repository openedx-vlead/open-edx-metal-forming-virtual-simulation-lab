<p>The given simulation video of sheet hydroforming process shows the variation of strain and temperature generated during the progress of process. In the left hand side of the video show the variation of strain on the inner surface of the sheet. The left side of the video shows the scale with different colors that depict different level of strain starting from zero. Initially the strain in the sheet is zero which is shown with blue color of sheet. With the progress of process, the strain generated is reached up to 0.920 at different regions of sheet. At the corner of sheet the strain raises up to 1.53. The right hand top side of the video shows the variation of strain at outer surface of the sheet. The strain varies at different regions of the sheet with time. The maximum strain generated in the sheet is 0.834. The right hand bottom side of the video shows the variation of temperature on the sheet. The left side of the video shows scale with different color regions starting from blue color with temperature 20�C Initially the temperature of sheet is 20�C. With the advancement of the process, the temperature increases initially from 20�C to 34�C and then decreases upto 30�C.</p>
