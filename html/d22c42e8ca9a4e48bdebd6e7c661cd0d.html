<p>On the left side, one can observe the Step-1 of Hub Cap. In this step, one could observe the circular profile and holes are being formed by the cold forming process. The upper die is moving downwards and one can see the changes in the meshed red sheet. On the right side, the yellow part shows the upper die and on the bottom side of the screen the green part shows the lower die. The two red parts in the middle, shows the initial and the final sheet respectively before and after step 1.Generally, we take low alloy steel sheet for making Hub Cap. It undergoes cold forming process to form circular profile in between and holes.</p>
