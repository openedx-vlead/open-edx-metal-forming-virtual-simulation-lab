Forming operation may be defined as an upsetting process, normally formed at the end of a square sheet. Forming process can be carried out cold, and hot. In a given simulation of corrugated sheet forming, cold forming process is used. In this simulation video not half section of billet (square sheet) is shown as the billet is square shape. The corrugatedsheet forming is normally done in two step but for ease of the simulation, bolt is made in a single step. Consider the various perimeters of forming simulation. The material (sheet) of the billet is plane carbon steel and the temperature of the billet is 20<sup>o</sup>C. In the simulation video the billet is in the finite element to have better analysis of the force. The hydraulic press is used for deformation. On the left hand top side of the simulation video one can see the arrangement of the upper die or punch, the billet and lower die. In The left hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation of strain in the billet during the forming operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises up to 1.806 greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video we can see the upper die, billet (plain sheet), lower die and final corrugated sheet. In the right hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation of temperature in the billet (sheet) during the operation. At the end of the operation the temperature rises up to 20<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;</td>
