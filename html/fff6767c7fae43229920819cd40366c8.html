In the process shown above, we have an upper die on which there is an impression of a medal. The lower die contains a cavity for placing billet (coin or medal). This does not allows the flow of billet when pressed by the upper die. The process starts by placing billet inside the lower die followed by the plastic deformation of medal due to heavy impact of the upper die. This simulation uses an alloy of aluminium as billet and the velocity of upper die is 10 mm/sec at ï¿½ = 0.2 friction.</td>
