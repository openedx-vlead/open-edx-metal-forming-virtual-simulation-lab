<p>Screw is formed by heading operation. Heading process may be defined as an upsetting process, normally performed at the end of a round rod in order to produce a larger cross-section. Heading processes can be carried out cold, warm or hot. In the given simulation of screw forming, cold heading process is used. The screw forming is normally done in two steps but for ease of the simulation, screw is made in a single step. Consider the various parameters of heading simulation. The material of the billet is plain carbon steel. the temperature of the billet is 20<sup>o</sup>C. In the simulation video the billet is divided into small finite elements to have better analysis of the force. The mechanical press is used for deformation. In the left hand side of the simulation video one can see the processing of the screw. In the right hand bottom side of the video we can see the upper die, lower die, initial billet and final billet. Similarly in the left hand bottom side of the video we can see the variation e in the billet during the operation.&nbsp;</p>
