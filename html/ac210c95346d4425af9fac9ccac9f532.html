<p>On left hand side, the full in section of Tube Hydroforming-single T setup is shown. The tube is shown in red, the die in green and pistons in yellow. As the piston pushes the tube, the tube starts occupying the T shape under fluid pressure. On the right hand side, a picture is shown. The top end of the picture shows, transformation from initial shape of tube to final T shape of tube. On the bottom end of the picture, the full setup of a single T Hydroforming process is described. The die is shown in green. The tube is shown in red and is placed in the die having a T. The piston is shown in yellow and it moves in the green die which consists of fluid.</p>
