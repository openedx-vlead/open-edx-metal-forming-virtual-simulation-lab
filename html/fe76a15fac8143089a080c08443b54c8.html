<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">In the left hand side of the simulation video we can see the variation of strain in the billet during riveting operation. Similarly in the right hand top side of the video we can see thevariation of strain with mesh in the billet during riveting operation. In the right hand bottom side of the video one can depict the variation of temperature in the billet during the operation by the graph.&nbsp;</td>
