<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">On the left hand side one can see the crankshaft hot forging-step 1. On the extreme left, the scale shows the equivalent strains generated in the crankshaft. On the right hand side, the picture shows 3 red parts. The 1<sup>st</sup> red part is the initial billet which is used for 1<sup>st</sup> step forging. The 2nd red part shows the forged billet after the 1<sup>st</sup> step. This is the intermediate step. The 3rd red part shows the final forged crankshaft after forging in step-2. The lower two yellow parts shows the upper dies used for step 1 and step 2 processes respectively. The green coloured part shows the lower die which used for both steps.&nbsp;</td>
