<p>Mudguard is made from steel sheet by cold sheet metal forming process. In this sheet forming process, the sheet is pressed between two dies and the final mudguard is obtained by bending of sheet. In the given video of the simulation one can see the upper die, lower die and the sheet. The material of the sheet is stainless steel. The temperature of the billet is 28ï¿½C and the friction is sliding in nature. The hammer press is used for pressing the sheet. The left hand side of the video shows the position and the motion of upper die, lower die and the sheet. The sheet is placed on lower die and the upper die presses the sheet. On the right hand top side of the video one can see the initial billet and final billet. While on the right hand bottom side of the video one can see the variation in billet during deformation.</p>
