Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation. It rises upto 0.16721. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. In the left hand side of the video one can depict the variation of strain with mesh in the billet during the forming operation. In the right hand side of the video one can depict the variation of the temperature in the billet during the operation by the graph, the graph plot between the force and pilot height.&nbsp;</td>
