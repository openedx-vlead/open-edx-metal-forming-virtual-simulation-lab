On the top shows the simulation of roll forming. In this roll forming simulation the equivalent strain generated in the sheet is shown on the bottom left. The three different zones of strains can be clearly visualized as the sheet passes through the three pair of rollers. On the bottom right the graph for the force experienced by the rollers can be seen. The graph is plotted between the time and the force in tonnes. The maximum force required is 0.33 tonnes.</p>
