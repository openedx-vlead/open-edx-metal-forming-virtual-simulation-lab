<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">This simulation depicts the set-up of the thread rolling using two rolls process. In this video, we could see that on the left side of the screen, we have the full assembly of the threading process which includes two rolls in yellow and green colour, two mutually opposite guides in blue and pink colours respectively, a billet in red colour. The billet is been rolled upon against the grooved surface of the rolls thus making the respective threads while rotating in the manner opposite to that of the rolls. The top right side of the screen showing the enlarged view of the treaded region of the billet and the lower right corner of the screen showing the graph between the force applied on the rolls by the formed billet versus time. The graph depicts the sinusoidal curve like increase and decrease of the force on rolls with the passage of time.&nbsp;</td>
