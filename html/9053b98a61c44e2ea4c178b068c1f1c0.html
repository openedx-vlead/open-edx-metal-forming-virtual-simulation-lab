<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">In the given simulation video one can see the hot riveting process. In this video the rivet is used to tie the two sheets. The various parts of the process are punch, lower, two sheets one over other and the rivet. The process is hot forming in nature. The left hand side of the video shows the positions of various components of the process. The material of the billet is brass and the temperature is 150<sup>o</sup>C. Initially the rivet is placed in its position and the punch is moved downward to press the rivet from the top. The right hand top side of the simulation video shows the various component like upper die, lower die, sheet-1 and sheet-2. The right hand bottom side of the video shows the strain with mesh in the billet during the deformation.&nbsp;</td>
