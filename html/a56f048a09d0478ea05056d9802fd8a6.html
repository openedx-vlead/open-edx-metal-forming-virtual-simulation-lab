<p>Stretch forming process is a cold working bending process. In this video you can see a sheet is clamped with the help of bolts in clampers. The temperature of billet maintained to 20<sup>o</sup>C and material of the billet is carbon steel. Hydraulic press is used to deform the billet. The Lower die with hydraulic press compresses the billet with high force in upward direction and stretching take place in the sheet. Equivalent strain in billet is shown over the left side of video. The graph between pilot height and forces generated by lower die are shownover right side of video. Due to high deforming force and low temperature, material starts deforming plastically and at final step it has permanent elongation.&nbsp;</p>
