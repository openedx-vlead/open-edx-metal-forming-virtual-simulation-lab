<p>This simulation depicts the set-up of the thread rolling technique using flat dies along with the graph. In this video, we could see that on the top section of the screen, we have the full assembly of the threading process which includes two well grooved flat dies in yellow and green colour and a billet in between them in red colour. The two flat dies tends to reciprocate at direction opposite to each other, thus forcing the billet to turn and create threads on its surface while rotating. The lower left side of the screen showing the enlarged view of the threaded region of the billet and the lower right corner of the screen showing the graph between the force applied on the dies by the formed billet at versus time period. Note that this force goes on decreasing in magnitude with the passage of time.&nbsp;</p>
