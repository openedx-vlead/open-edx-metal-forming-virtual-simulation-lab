<p>This simulation depicts the set-up of the thread rolling using three rolls. In this video, we could see that on the left side of the screen, we have the full assembly of the thread rolling process, which includes three rolls in yellow and green and dark blue colour, a billet in between them in red colour. The billet is been rolled upon against the grooved surface of three mutually equidistant rolls, thus making the respective threads on the billet surface, while rotating in the manner opposite to that of the rolls. The top right side of the screen showing the enlarged view of the treaded region of the billet whereas the lower right corner of the screen showing the graph between the force applied on the rolls by the formed billet versus time. This graph depicting the increase in force on the rolls with time in a certain pattern of peaks and valleys.&nbsp;</p>
