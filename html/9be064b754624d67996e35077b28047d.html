<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">Alloy wheel forming process comprises billet compression and deformation by closed impression die forming process. The upper half and lower half sections of the alloy wheel are impressed on the upper and lower dies respectively and maintaining temperature of billet to 350<sup>o</sup>C the forming of alloy wheel take place. Right hand side of video shows variation of equivalent strain on billet. The material of the billet is Aluminum alloy or magnesium alloy. Hydraulic press is used to deform the billet. The upper die with hydraulic press compresses the billet with very high force in downward direction and deforms it. Due to high deforming force and high billet temperature, material starts deforming plastically and moves into the impressions created in the upper and lower die. At the final height the billet is deformed into finished alloy wheel. Final shape is obtained after various heat treatment processes and machining of the forged alloy wheel. Final formed alloy wheel is shown at the end.</td>
