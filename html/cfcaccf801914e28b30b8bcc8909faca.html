<p>In this simulation video forming of corrugated sheets is shown in a continuous manner. In this process it requires a pair of grooved rollers. The sheet material is an aluminium alloy. The rollers are kept in such a way that the crest of one roller faces the trough of the other roller. Thus this arrangement helps to deform a plain sheet into a corrugated one in a continuous fashion. This arrangement is used when large sheets are to be made for a commercial purpose. The groove design taken here is round in shape. This design can be changed according to the shape of corrugated sheet.</p>
