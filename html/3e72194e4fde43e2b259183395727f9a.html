<p>On the left side, one can observe the Step-2 of Hub Cap. In this step, one could observe the cold shearing of windows of Hub Cap. The upper die is moving downwards and one can see the changes in the red sheet after Step-1. On the right hand, top end, one can observe the colored contours describing the distance between upper die and lower die is shown. Whereas on the right hand, bottom end, one can observe the equivalent strains generated on sheet when a cut plane cuts the sheet. One can easily see the shearing operation taking place in this cut section. The equivalent strains generated can be described by the scale on the left.</p>
