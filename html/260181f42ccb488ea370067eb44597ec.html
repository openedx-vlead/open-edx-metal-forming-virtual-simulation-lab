<p>On the top left hand corner of screen, one can visualize the tube hydroforming process of Double T on opposite side. The die is shown in green, tube in red and pistons with yellow and blue colour. As the piston moves inside the die, deformation of tube on opposite side, near T can be observed Just below this, we have a magnified view of T section describing about the equivalent strains generated on external surface of tube. The different color contours can be compared with the scale on extreme left of screen. The graph in the middle shows the Force vs Pilot Height graph with Pilot height on X axis and Force on Y axis. On top right hand corner, one can view transformation of initial tube in red to final tube in blue with contours at T section. On the bottom right hand corner, the setup is shown.&nbsp;</p>
