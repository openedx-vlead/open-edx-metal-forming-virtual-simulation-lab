<p>In this video, one could observe the basic drawing operation taking place on the left hand side. The initial circular plate is taken as cold. It is kept in between the two stationary central dies with the movable side dies both on the upper and the lower side. As the movable die moves keeping the central part stationary the cupping of plate takes place. The equivalent strain generated in the circular plate can be determined through the scale on the extreme left. The forging force evolution during drawing process can be seen on the graph shown on the right hand side.</p>
