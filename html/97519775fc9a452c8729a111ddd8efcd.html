<p>In this simulation video the variation of equivalent strain in the billet using forging process is shown. Initially the equivalent strain in the billet is zero. During successive passes of cogging process the strain in various regions of billet increases. Greater strain in the billet indicates severe deformation of material and hence better grain structure. Due to the repetitive pressure on the left part of the billet it results to a better grain structure in compare to the right section of billet. In the right hand simulation video the graph shows the variation of the force applied by the upper die along z-direction with steps on the round billet. From the graph one can depict that with the successive passes, the force required for the deformation of billet increases. This is due to grain structure improvement of the billet on deformation at high temperature with successive blows.&nbsp;</p>
