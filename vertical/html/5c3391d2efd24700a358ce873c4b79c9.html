<p>This sheet metal bending simulation depicts, a simple v bending operation is shown. The punch used here is a simple v punch &amp; the die used here is also of v type. In This type of bending the bend angle of sheet is same as that of the die angle. The sheet taken here is of 1mm in diameter. Punch velocity in downward direction is 3 mm/s. The variation of the punch force required is shown in the graph on the right side. The maximum punch force is 0.06 tonne. The colored strip on the left side shows the different values of equivalent strain. The generation of strain can be seen at the bending portion.</p>
