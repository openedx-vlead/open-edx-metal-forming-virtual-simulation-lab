<p>In indirect extrusion process, the die moves toward the billet; thus, except at the die, there is no relative motion at the billet container interface. This process is specially advantageous for materials with high billet-container friction. Here one can see the hollow ram or die forces against the stationary work-piece which has been backed up the flat end of the upper die. This operation is marked by no relative displacement between the containing die and the billet, so we see there is no friction involved between them, which greatly improves the external surface finish of the finished product. However, one has to remove the lower hollow die that has been pierced upwards into the billet regarding extrusion of the part which sometimes gets stuck to the billet part due to certain plastic deformation, also making this process discontinuous. Here in this video one can see on the left side of the screen the various components involved in this process, they are the cylindrical container meant for enclosing all the other parts, the work-piece been held up against the gravity by the ram action in the cylindrical container, the lower die with the internal bore which is backed up the hollow ram for its upward motion. The right side video shows the movement of this hollow die and hollow ram in the upward and downward direction to and fro into the cylindrical bore of the container.</p>
