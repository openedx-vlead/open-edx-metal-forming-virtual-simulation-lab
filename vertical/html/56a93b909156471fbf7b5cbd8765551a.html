<p>This simulation depicts the results coming from the Finite Element Analysis of the thread rolling technique using two rolls. In this video, we could see that on the upper section of the screen, we have the equilateral strain generated regions, coming from the thread rolling process at various point in time. Note that at the point where the roll first comes in contact with then billet we have the maximum strain generated, that could be seen in red colour, which slowly fades into yellow , then into green and finally into blue colour bands. The lower section of the screen showing the varying pressure zones coming during the process. The green colour showing the low pressure regions, the yellow colour showing slightly high pressure region, and red colour region showing very high pressure regions in increasing order of magnitude, which can be as high as up-to 200MPa of pressure.&nbsp;</p>
