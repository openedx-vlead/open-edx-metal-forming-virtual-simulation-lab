<p>On the left side, one can observe the setup of hot forging of piston. The meshed cylindrical billet is placed in the green die and the yellow upper die is moving downwards. The change in microstructure can be seen with change in mesh size. On the right hand, top side, equivalent strains generated in billet when observed from top where as on the right hand, bottom end , equivalent strains generated are shown in billet as a cut plane cuts the setup. One can observe the reverse upsetting process here. The colored contours can be described by the scale on the left of screen.</p>
