<p>This simulation depicts one of the common type of defect which occurs in forging called Shearing defect. In this video, we could see that on the left side of the screen we have the set up of the general forging process, in which an upper die presses against the billet, deforming it in the usual manner, but due to certain design error of the die, we have shearing of the material of the billet instead of usual deformation of the billet. This is pointed by the arrow on the right side of the screen at the end of the simulation.&nbsp;</p>
