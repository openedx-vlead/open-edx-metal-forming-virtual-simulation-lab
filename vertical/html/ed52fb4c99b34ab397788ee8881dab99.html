<p>Bead forming is used to make a round corner of a sheet or a rod. In this video one can see the setup of beading process for forming a bead at the rod end. The upper die moves downward which bends the rod end and forms it to bead shape. On right hand side, equivalent strain generated in the rod is shown. The maximum strain generated is 2.9. Change in the value of equivalent strain refers to the refinement of the microstructure of the material. Higher the equivalent strain more finer is the microstructure.</p>
