<p>Orbital forming is a metal forming process used for spreading internal diameter of axis symmetric cylindrical objects. In the present simulation a cylindrical specimen (length = 121 mm and internal diameter 27 mm) is subjected to orbital forming. Metal specimen is placed in the lower die holder and orbital forming probe (rotating plunger) is placed in the specimen initial cavity. Now probe rotates along the vertical axis and simultaneously tilt at certain angle (rocking angle), angle of inclination is time dependent and gradually increases. Angle can be pre-adjustable to impart desirable shape to the object.&nbsp;</p>
