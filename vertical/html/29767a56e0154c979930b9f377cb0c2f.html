<p>Bushing is formed by FORMING process, which may be defined as an upsetting process, which is normally performed at the end of the cylindrical round rod or wire in order to produce larger crossï¿½section. In the given simulation of bush &nbsp;forming is cold processing is used. The bush forming is normally done in the three steps.</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Left hand top side of the video we can see the arrangement of the die, billet or punch. And left hand bottom side we can see the variation in the billet during the operation by the graph. Similarly in the right hand top side the punch moving along the upward direction then after billet is converted &nbsp;in the punch shape. And in the right hand bottom side we can see variation of the &nbsp;strain in the billet during the operation. Initially the strain in the billet is zero while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation up to 1.0. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties.</p>
<p>Step 2:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Right hand top side we can see the punch moving in the upward direction. When the punch moves then the billet also changes and after it comes in the punch shape. In the Right hand bottom side we can see the variation of the strain in the billet during the operation. Initially the strain in the billet is 0.218833 while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation up to 2.18833. Greater strain indicates more deformation, more grain refinement and hence better mechanical properties. On the Left hand top side of the video we can see the arrangement of the die, billet or punch. And the left hand bottom side we can see the variation in the billet during the operation by the graph.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>In the Right hand top side we can see the punch moving in the upward direction. When the punch moves then the billet have changed and after it comes in the punch shape. On the Right hand bottom side we can see the variation of strain in the billet during the operation. Initially &nbsp;the strain in the billet is 0.144286 while during the operation the strain rises due to deformation up to 6.57492. On the Left hand top side of the video we can see the arrangement of the die, billet or punch. And left hand bottom side we can see the variation in the billet during the operation by the graph.</p>
