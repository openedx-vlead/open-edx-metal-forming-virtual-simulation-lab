<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">This simulation depicts the results obtained from the swaging process, i.e. distribution of pressure and temperature profiles along various zones of the billet. In this video, we could see that on the top end of the screen, we have the varying pressure zones ranging from -50 to 50 MPa of the punch force on the billet surface. The bottom end of the screen shows varying temperature profile acting along the surface of the billet. Observe that as the billet comes out after being punched the temperature slowly falls down from 600<sup>o</sup>C to 300<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;</td>
