<p>This Forming process comprises brass material billet compression and deformation by closed impression die forming process. Upsetting process is shown over here and temperature for brass material billet is maintained as 600oC to make hot die forging process. Hydraulic press is used to deform the billet. The upper die with hydraulic press compresses the billet with very high force in downward direction and deforms it. Due to high deforming force and high billet temperature, material starts deforming plastically and moves into the impressions created in the upper and lower die. Right hand side shows graph between forces on upper die and pilot height and in the lower right half lower and upper dies are shown. At the final height the billet is deformed into finished product. Final shape is obtained after various heat treatment processes and machining of the forged part.</p>
