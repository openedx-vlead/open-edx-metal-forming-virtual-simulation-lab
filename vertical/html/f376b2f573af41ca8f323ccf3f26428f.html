<p>The following video shows the working of the hydraulic press consisting of the ram connected with the upper die. The working fluid used in the hydraulic press is water off course. The upper die is moved by the action of the pressurised water which flows in and out of the main hydraulic cylinder through the upper and bottom pipes in the cylinder. Initially at the downward stroke of the piston the water is been pressurised through the upper pipe into the cylinder and during this stroke the work-piece is been pressed hydraulically with the constant pressure between the set of the upper and the lower die, making it to take the shape of the cavity made in between these two dies. The upper die is made to restore its initial position by making the water to flow into the cylinder in a pressurised manner into the lower pipe.&nbsp;</p>
