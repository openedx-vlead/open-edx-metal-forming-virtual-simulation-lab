The process of upsetting is not done in a single step but in multiple steps using the same hammer press. On the right side, one could view the forging force on the upper die in different steps. On the left side, the process of deformation can be seen with a scale describing about the equivalent strains being generated in the billet during hammer forging process. In the final step the billet takes up the shape of the dies.</p>
