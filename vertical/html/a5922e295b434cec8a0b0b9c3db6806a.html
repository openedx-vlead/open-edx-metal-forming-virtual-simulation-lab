<p>In the given simulation video of ripple formation process one can see the strain generated in the tube and variation of force with time. In the left hand side of the video one can see the strain generated inside the tube during the bulging and collapsing process. In the left hand side one can see the vertical scale with different colours. Each colour shows different level of strain generated inside the tube starting from blue which correspond to zero strain level. More strain in the tube indicates more deformation and more deformation gives more strength to the tube. The maximum strain generated inside the tube is about 1.4. In the right hand top side of the video shows the strain generated on the outer surface of the tube. Maximum strain generated on the outer surface of the tube is about 1.4 but overall average strain generated on the outer surface of the tube is about 0.4. The right hand bottom side of the video shows the graph showing variation of force acting on the tube by upper die with time. The maximum force generated on the tube is 0.8896 tonnes.&nbsp;</p>
