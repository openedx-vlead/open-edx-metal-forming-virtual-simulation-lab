<td style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 5px; line-height: 20px;">In the video, one could see a simple poppet valve being forged. In the first step, upsetting of initial billet is done filling up the cavity in the bottom die insert. A part of the stem is formed in this step. In the second step, the head of poppet valve is formed and the stem is formed. The left hand corner shows a scale describing the equivalent strain generated inside the billet during the forming operation. At the bottom, the graph of Forging Force vs Pilot Height is shown describing how the forging force is varying during the process.&nbsp;</td>
