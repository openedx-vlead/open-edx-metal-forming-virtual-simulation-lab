<p>In the given simulation video the rivet is placed in its position and the punch is moved downward to press the rivet from the top. The right hand top side of the simulation video shows the strain generated during the deformation. At the end of the process the equivalent strain on the rivet rises upto 3.1827. The rivet is deformed severely from the top and hence the mechanical strength of the rivet is highly improved. The right hand bottom side of the video shows the variation of the force during the deformation.</p>
