<p>In the video, one could see a simple poppet valve being forged. In the first step, upsetting of initial billet is done filling up the cavity in the bottom die insert. A part of the stem is formed in this step. In the second step, the head of poppet valve is formed and the stem is formed. The left hand corner shows a scale describing the equivalent strain generated inside the billet during the forming operation.</p>
